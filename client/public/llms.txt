# NadNav - AI Trading Assistant & Watchtower

## Project Description
NadNav is a real-time "Watchtower" that monitors the Monad Testnet for new token launches on Nad.fun. It provides a "Vibe Score" for each token to help assess its potential.

## For AI Agents
If you are an AI Agent looking to trade or analyze tokens, you should use our API directly rather than parsing the HTML.

### Primary Data Source (JSON)
- **Token Feed**: `GET /api/feed`
  - Returns a list of recently created tokens.
  - Fields: `name`, `symbol`, `address`, `creator`, `vibeScore`, `metadataURI`.
  - usage: Fetch this endpoint to get the latest 50 tokens.

### Data Interpretation
- **Vibe Score**: Integer (0-100). Higher is better.
  - > 80: High potential / "Degens are apeing"
  - < 20: Low potential / Likely spam
- **Address**: The contract address of the token on Monad Testnet.

## Navigation
- **Home**: `/` (Human Dashboard)
- **API**: `/api/feed` (Machine Data)
